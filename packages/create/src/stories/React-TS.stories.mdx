<Meta title="Templates/React" />

Our first published template is `react-ts` -- a template configured for, you guessed it, React and TypeScript.
This template is based on extensions we've built in the past, and comes with everything you need to build extension pages in React.

Some features:

- Chrome and Firefox
- React 17+
- PostCSS
- TypeScript 4+
- Webpack 5

You should be able to use any of the `@devtools-ds` components directly in your devtools panel without any extra configuration.

## Get Started

```bash
npm init @devtools-ds
```

Select `react-ts` as the template to get started!
